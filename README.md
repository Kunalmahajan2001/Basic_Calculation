1.Write a script to declare a variable name and assign it your name. Display the value of the variable using console.log.
2.Declare a variable age and assign it your age. Then, change the value of age to 5 years older. Print both the original and updated values.
3.Declare two variables, firstName and lastName. Assign them your first and last name respectively. Concatenate them into a single variable fullName and print it.
4.Declare a variable num and assign it the value 10. Multiply it by 5 and print the result.
5.
Declare two variables, x and y, and assign them the values 8 and 3 respectively. Compute and print the result of x + y, x - y, x * y, and x / y.
6.Declare a variable temperature with an initial value of 20. Reassign it to a string value "twenty degrees". Print the variable before and after reassignment to observe type coercion.
7.Declare a variable value and assign it the string "10". Add 5 to this variable and print the result. What do you observe? Explain why it happens.
8.Create two variables, a and b, and assign them the values 15 and 4 respectively. Use the modulo operator to find the remainder when a is divided by b. Print the result.
9.Declare a variable counter and initialize it to 0. Use the increment operator to increase its value by 1 three times, printing the value after each increment.
10.
Declare three variables, p, q, and r, and assign them the values 5, 10, and 15 respectively. Calculate the result of the expression (p + q) * r / q - p and print it.*
11.Declare a variable result and assign it the value 10. Multiply it by 2, then subtract 5, and finally add 7. Print the final value.
12.Declare four variables, m, n, o, and p, and assign them the values 2, 4, 6, and 8 respectively. Evaluate and print the result of the expression ((m + n) * o) / (p - m).
